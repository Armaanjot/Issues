I’m currently doing the quest “corrupted betrayal” and i’m at the point in which I have to enter the broken house at
"-732, 65, -974 In Troms. Everytime I drop down into the slimy cave the game kicks me and gives me a error message. 
(“Internal Exception: java.lan.NullPointerException”) once I log back in i’m stuck in a small box with no cut scene and all 
I can do is /kill myself. I am currently using Minecraft version 1.12.2 and Wyntills this happens everytime I drop into the cave.
